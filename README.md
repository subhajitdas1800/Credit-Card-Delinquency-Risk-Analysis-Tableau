# Credit Card Delinquency Risk Analysis | Tableau
##Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing credit card customer behavior to identify key drivers of delinquency risk. Using Tableau, the dashboard combines financial, behavioral, and repayment indicators to help stakeholders proactively detect high‑risk customers and improve credit risk management strategies.

The analysis highlights how factors such as credit utilization, missed payments, income, credit score, and debt‑to‑income ratio (DTI) influence delinquency.
