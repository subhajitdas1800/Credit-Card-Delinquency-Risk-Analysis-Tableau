# Credit Card Delinquency Risk Analysis | Tableau
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing credit card customer behavior to identify key drivers of delinquency risk. Using Tableau, the dashboard combines financial, behavioral, and repayment indicators to help stakeholders proactively detect high‑risk customers and improve credit risk management strategies.

The analysis highlights how factors such as credit utilization, missed payments, income, credit score, and debt‑to‑income ratio (DTI) influence delinquency.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is available within this GitHub repository:
- <a href="https://github.com/subhajitdas1800/Credit-Card-Delinquency-Risk-Analysis-Tableau/blob/main/Delinquency_prediction_dataset%20(1).xlsx">Credit Card Customer Dataset (Excel)</a>

## Business Objective
To support risk, collections, and credit policy teams by:
- Identifying patterns associated with delinquent accounts
- Monitoring monthly repayment behavior
- Enabling data‑driven decisions for early intervention

## KPIs
The dashboard tracks the following core metrics:
- % Delinquent Accounts: 16.0%
- Average Income: ₹108,324
- Average Credit Score: 578
- Average Credit Utilization: 48.3%

## Project Insights 
- Credit Utilization & Delinquency: Customers who use a smaller portion of their credit limit are much more likely to pay on time, while higher usage puts more financial pressure on customers and increases the risk of late payments.
- Missed Payments Impact: Customers who have missed payments in the past are more likely to become delinquent, showing that past repayment behavior is a strong indicator of future risk.
- Monthly Late Payment Trend: The percentage of late payments remains almost the same every month, which suggests that delinquency is a regular behavior pattern rather than a one-time or seasonal issue.
- Payment Status Mix: Each month shows a steady mix of on-time, missed, and late payments, helping banks understand the overall health of their customer portfolio.
- Debt-to-Income (DTI) Insight: Customers with higher debt compared to their income struggle more with repayments, making high DTI a key warning sign for potential delinquency.

## Tools & Technologies
- Tableau – Dashboard creation & visualization
- Excel – Data cleaning & preprocessing
- EDA Techniques – Aggregations, binning, trend analysis

## Project Context
This project was completed as part of the **Tata GenAI Powered Data Analytics Job Simulation** on Forage.  
The simulation is designed to provide hands-on experience in solving real-world business problems using data analysis and visualization techniques.

## Conclusion
This project shows that credit card delinquency is mainly driven by customer behavior and financial stress. Factors such as high credit utilization, repeated missed payments, employment instability, card type, and location significantly increase delinquency risk. The Tableau dashboard and report together demonstrate how data-driven insights can help financial institutions identify at-risk customers early and support better credit risk decisions.
